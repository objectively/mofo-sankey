Inspired by my indigenous values of co-creation. When a computer program needs to reference another piece of software, we call that a “dependency.” In software development a dependency is as good as law — better maybe, because one module needs the other in order to run. It literally can’t work otherwise. This means dependencies are effectively a way developers impose some conditions on any application using their work. But technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum. New technologies can have immense ethical effects. I wondered — what is the ethical analog of a dependency? How can software developers and other technologists make sure their work is deployed in accordance with a certain set of values? Wampum.codes is my way of exploring that idea. It’s a podcast named after wampum, the craft of weaving beads into patterns that represent contracts and other agreements, and was practiced by my tribe (Seneca-Cayuga Haudenosaunee) for many years.
